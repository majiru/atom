.I id
] title link path
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Atom
is a not quite RFC4287 compliant atom feed generator.
.I Atom
takes a feed title, base url, and directory path
and creates one feed entry per file within the directory.
The generated atom feed is printed on standard output.
Each entry is expected to live at the concatination of
the feed url and the last member of the files path. Entry
titles are generated by stripping their file extension.
The feed updated time is set to the current time, while
each entry's udpated field is set to the files mtime.
Each flag modifies the meta information of the feed,
.I name
and
.I id
default to glenda and '9front atom' respectively.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The ID for each entry is taken from its Qid path.
All timestamps are reported in UTC.

The lack of compliance is due to whitespace issues with how
.IR xml(2)
outputs, most atom implementations that use generic xml
parsers seem to work fine.
